# Chest X-rays Classification

Welcome to the Chest X-ray Classification project! This deep learning project aims to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them to determine the presence of various diseases. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in efficiently diagnosing chest-related illnesses, particularly focusing on conditions affecting the respiratory system.

This project is part of the [#mlzoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/) course.

The main objective of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately classify chest X-ray images into different disease categories. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset, encompassing a range of common chest diseases.

## Data

### Dataset

The dataset follows a simple directory structure, branching into "test" and "train" sets. Each set is further categorized into three classes, representing specific chest diseases. This organization aids in the seamless retrieval of images for training and testing purposes.

Classes
The dataset comprises images associated with three distinct chest conditions:

Class 1: COVID
Class 2: Viral Pneumonia
Class 3: Normal
